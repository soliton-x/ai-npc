AI NPC World is a groundbreaking virtual environment where AI NPCs (Non-Player Characters) autonomously interact, adapt, and evolve based on player inputs.

This project is a collaboration between:
- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/): Pioneers in machine learning tools and resources.
- [Gigax](https://github.com/GigaxGames): Innovators in AI models for gaming.
- [Cubzh](https://cu.bzh): A versatile UGC (User-Generated Content) gaming platform.

## Stack

- Game Engine: [Cubzh](https://cu.bzh)
- AI Models: [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)
- NPC Behavior Framework: [Gigax](https://github.com/GigaxGames)
- Scripting: Lua
- Frontend: Browser-based 3D simulation

## Features

- **Auto-updating AI Behaviors:** NPCs adapt to player interactions dynamically.
- **Interactive Storytelling:** Players can influence the NPCs and the narrative.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Modify every aspect of NPC behavior and environment.
- **Fork & Hack:** Easily fork the project on Hugging Face to create your own worlds.
- **Voxel Library:** Access a library of 25k voxel items to enhance your game scenes.

## Installation

**Note**: There is a one-click install option for this project on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/projects/ai-npc-world) for those who want to run it without modification.

### 1. Clone the repository and install packages

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cubzh/ai-npc-world.git
cd ai-npc-world
